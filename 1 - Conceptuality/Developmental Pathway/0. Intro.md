# Intro to LifeWeb

**Why**: LifeWeb is dedicated to enabling self-organization of communities, at bioregional scales (somewhere between local and global), dedicated to manifesting regenerative--Life-affirming--patterns in the world. 

**What**: LifeWeb is an online space of pure potential (an uncontested space, "above" or "outside" the internet), where the thickness of relations we can only currently intuit become visible. 

**How**: LifeWeb is built around a continuous pathway, that guides participants as they inhabit, that is, living into the fullness of their Being: a transformative journey from self-actualization to system-actualization. 

**Framing**: LifeWeb sources its framing for its developmental pathway from John G. Bennett's 12 categories describe the continuum of human experience, as a whole with with distinct emergences or transitions.

**Process**: The complete LifeWeb journey spans over 12 steps, divided into 3 segments (self, field, system) as follows:

### A. Co-here-ing wholeness: Finding your here together
In the first segment of the LifeWeb pathway (steps 1-4), Persons move from fragmented experience of reality* towards falling into place within the nested wholes. 
*It is because we do onto the world as fragments, that we are automatically destructive
### B. Activating Being: Discovering how immense we really are
In the second segment of the LifeWeb pathway (steps 5-8), Persons move from presence in their nested wholes towards radical participation within transformative ecosystems.
### C. Generating Aliveness: Re-patterning our world
In the third segment of the of LifeWeb pathway (steps 9-12), Participants move from participating in transformative ecosystems towards generating pathways together that transpose regenerative patterns form LifeWeb into the real world.
