# A. Co-*Here*-ing Wholeness: Finding your here together

In the first segment of the LifeWeb pathway (steps 1-4), Persons move from fragmented experience of reality* towards falling into place within the nested wholes. 
*It is because we do onto the world as fragments, that we are automatically destructive

By committing to inhabit LifeWeb, persons agree to participate radically, from their whole being. Their presence initiates a process revealing and authenticating their relations (and vice-versa), which actively generates a relational "map" for navigating the complex of wholeness of which they are truly a part of in the real world.

### Steps:
[[1. Wholeness]]: The opening of uncontested space
[[2. Polarity]]: Me-not me, claiming one's unique place
[[3. Relatedness]]: Relation reveal
[[4. Subsistence]]: Membrane confirmation
