Framework:
The first category is that of wholeness, which requires only one single term; namely, an element of experience that stands out in our awareness as present and persisting. 

If we go further and say that this element is itself and not other, we have already made the step to a two-term system and the category of polarity.

LifeWeb:

LifeWeb will be an uncontested space, "above" or "outside" the internet. The space will be dedicated to enabling self-organization of communities into transformative ecosystems (communities of place intersecting with communities of practice). This a space of pure potential, which holds the possibility of any occasion--in this case a person--to come into existence to claim a position in undifferentiated space.

Only the definition of entities themselves and the constitutive rules (rules-of-the-game) that guide how entities will interact and complexify, need to be established at this point. Complexification has to do with a thickness of relation amongst centers (persons, initiatives) that will form a polycentric, living structure exhibiting wholeness (a continuum of nested wholes beginning with person) and aliveness (patterned network of relations that constitute wholes at each scale).

More from Bennett:
Wholeness is omnipresent but relative.

Observing our experience and the behaviour of both living organisms and inanimate objects, we can discern a pattern of energy-exchanges to which we can apply the general term 'response'. There are different gradations of response that we express by words such as 'reaction'— 'sensation' — 'perception' — 'discrimination' — 'understanding'. The terms of this series are not well-defined, nor can we determine without further inquiry whether one form of response is independent of another.

Nevertheless, we can recognize a 'scale of response' that ranges over all that we know. If we now introduce the word wholeness, we are bound to admit that its meaning is relative to the gradation of response of which the object in question is capable. Inanimate objects can scarcely be said to recognize other wholes.

A crystal, for example, can take up material from a solution for its own growth, but it does not respond specifically to the presence of another crystal, like or unlike itself. We can recognize selective responses in mechanisms, such as slot-machines, that we ourselves construct, but their ability to react selectively to specific wholes, such as pennies, derives from human experience. Plants appear to have some little power to recognize and respond to other objects as wholes.* Animals—even the most primitive—show a higher gradation of response. The response to wholeness is unmistakable in animals endowed with a nervous system; but it is sensed rather than perceived. The discrimination of wholeness in man proves on examination to be less than we might suppose. Our speech implies that the names we use are wholes, but we seldom verify the meanings we intend to convey. There is, however, convincing evidence that man in a heightened state of consciousness acquires a direct perception of wholeness that goes far beyond name and form, and penetrates in some manner into the very essence of the thing perceived.
