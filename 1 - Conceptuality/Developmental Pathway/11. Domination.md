Framework:
Domination is the power that reconciles order and disorder without participating either in the one or in the other. It corresponds to the third category of relatedness transferred to the plane of universal processes. The eleventh category is discovered in experience as necessity. It can be recognized in Spinoza's dictum 'nature abhors a vacuum' or in the saying of Richard Frank 'necessity is the mother of invention'. All the tensions of the existing universe are reconciled by the community of needs. Necessity as the law that knows no law points to a category that has the power to produce its own opposite. This is domination which cannot be found until we have passed beyond creativity, for necessity, as the Greeks saw, is prior to creation. We can formulate as the principle of domination :
Domination is the power that reconciles order and disorder through the agency of creativity. It is the highest form of relatedness to be discovered in experience and requires eleven independent terms.
E.g. the eightfold individuality together with the polar force of order-disorder that is the source of pattern. We shall see later that creativity cannot be the source of a new Reality.
