# B. Activating Being: Discovering how immense we really are
In the second segment of the LifeWeb pathway (steps 5-8), Persons move from presence in their nested wholes towards radical participation within transformative ecosystems.

As Participants progress through the process of differentiation, there is an incremental bandwidth in relational capacity between nodes. This is a process that moves in two opposite, yet complimentary directions. There is a deepening of each persons self-knowledge of who they are and what they offer most uniquely. This is a broadening movement accomplished via a thickening of a field of relations, whose interactions, create opportunities for mirroring of self-knowledge of each person in relation within a larger whole they participate in together.

[[5. Potentiality]]: Reveal of capabilities and roles
[[6. Repetition]]: Relational bandwidth expands
[[7. Structure]]: Essence reveal
[[8. Individuality]]: Transformative ecosystem
