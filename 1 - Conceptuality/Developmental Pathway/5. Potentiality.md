Bennett: 
Potentiality can be expressed as two triads forming a dipole, but it has its own peculiar quality that none of the earlier categories can convey. (...) Once again it is necessary to go beyond 'thus and so' in order to take into account all that might be, but is not, present. This additional element of our experience is the category of potentiality that requires five independent terms for its exemplification. (...) potentiality requires five terms because it is necessary to distinguish between what is and what might be, as well as to account for all the relationships into which a given system can enter.

With potentiality, a person moves into being. Because the have an inner (self) and outer experience (other), potential for interactions opens up as a person with established relations reveals capabilities and roles (both represent potential energy in a system). Capabilities are confirmed in a community of practice (via open badges for example). Roles are confirmed in a community of place (via peer-to-peer reviews for example). Communities (of place/practice), that do not yet exist, are in left in potential mode, until person(s) step in to care for it. Potentiality is where the type of relation can begin to be differentiated. Here a correspondence is established.

More from Bennett: 
Potentiality or multiple subsistence arises when at least two similar triads share a common member in the initiating position. It therefore requires a system of not less than five independent terms. So far as we identify knowledge with sense-perception, we are bound to say that what we perceive exists and what we cannot perceive does not exist. Nevertheless, the status of actual and potential cannot be reduced to the simple opposition of existence and non-existence. Existence as a field of possible actualizations is not the 'bare existence' of Hegel, which is 'absolute indifference',* but rather 'being determinate'. To assert that B and C exist potentially in A is equivalent to saying that there are two triads ApB and AqC, both equally real where p and q are events having A as their initial moments.

According to our ordinary conceptions of space and time, the combination of ApB and AqC is impossible, for the two events B and C are required to occur at the same time and place. If, therefore, the proposition 'B and C are both potential in A' is to have a meaning, this meaning must be referred to a framework more ample than that of space and time alone. From such considerations we arrive at a five-dimensional representation-space, and also at the conclusion that potentiality requires a minimum of five independent terms.

Our sense-perceptions are confined to actual presentations. This might be, for example, the triad ApB. The unactualized possibility given by the triad AqC remains unperceived and, according to usual views, is to be regarded as non-existent. Reasoning based on the supposition that what is potential is non-existent leads to serious errors. In the long run it forces us to conclude that all our experience is inexplicable. The simple consideration that unactualized potentialities may at any moment become actual should be sufficient to convince us that they cannot be treated as non-existent. The principle of conservation of energy can hold only if potential energy is fully equivalent in its existential status with the energy of motion.

In that it is the first condition of independence, potentiality endows experience with that which is lacking in the earlier categories. The two relationships ApB and AqC can—but not necessarily do—represent for A the situation of choice, whereby one or the other becomes actual by virtue of what A is, and not as a result of antecedent causes. Hence i can be seen that not less than five terms are required in order to give a meaning to the conception of independence.

Potentiality is always more than subsistence. Everything that exists has potentialities for actualization that outstrip the relationships that it can sustain within any concrete situation. This is as true for inanimate objects as for living beings. All existence is exemplified in the seed that carries in its genetic pattern a potency for variation that can never be fully realized. Bradley's criticism of the 'dance of bloodless categories' could never be directed against potentiality rightly understood, for in it flows the bloodstream of existence, ever replenishing the source from which the temporal process is sustained. Potentiality is the eternal element in all experience.
