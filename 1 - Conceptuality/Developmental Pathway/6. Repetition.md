Framework: 
Repetition again carries us a step further towards the concreteness of experience in which to 'cognize' is to 'recognize'. (...) (MY: something missing here)

RE, moves from prefix to paradigm. Everything REs to remain in existence. Interactions between persons move beyond mere transaction toward a regularity of frequency. There is a reproduction of relatedness sustained across time.

More from Bennett: 
Repetition is the property whereby identity, difference, and relatedness are combined in a single system, and for this a minimum of six terms is required.

Experience teaches us that the words 'same' and 'other' are mutually dependent in the sense that we cannot speak of either without importing some of the meaning of both. There is nothing in the first five principles which requires that 'same' and 'other' should be bound together in this way, and therefore we have to recognize a new characteristic of our experience. If we consider the system A B C D E F, we can see that this can be regarded as two independent triads A B C and D E F, or as two tetrads A B C D and C D E F, which share half their terms. Such a system enables the combination of same and other to be established, and can, therefore, be called repetition. It is not too much to say that the principle of repetition is the basis of epistemology, for without it there could be no recognition and, hence, neither knowledge nor the possibility of understanding.

When we examine the minimum number of terms which a system must have in order to exemplify the principle of repetition, we can see that it is not sufficient to make the distinction between actual and potential, for this distinction could arise in a static system where nothing occurs. Potential energy can be stored up indefinitely, but it does not renew itself. Repetition requires the twofold action of a disturbing and a resisting force—that is vibration. It follows from this that to pass from potentiality to repetition, six independent elements must be present in the situation, for disturbing and restoring forces are conceptions that have no meaning in terms of the first five principles.

One aspect of the sixth principle can be appreciated if we remember that all precise knowledge, all measurement, is possible only through the observation of repetitive processes. The measurement of time—the determination of length—the discovery of proportions—all require repetitive instruments such as clocks and rulers, and the recognition of likenesses and differences in what we observe.

Nevertheless, the epistemological significance of repetition is only a secondary feature. Repetition not only gives us what we know but makes us what we are. We could understand nothing and do nothing if life did not repeat. Potentialities might really exist, but without repetition we could make nothing of them.

The ancients accepted cyclicity as axiomatic, and took it too much for granted to be able to see its place. Gianbattista Vico was perhaps the last philosopher to see in repetition a cosmic principle of explanation.

Since his time secularity, or the belief that events proceed in a definite direction, has superseded his concept of reflux. And yet its importance remains, only, not as a principle unique and ultimate, but rather as one of the categories without which no valid thinking is possible.*
