Why: LifeWeb is dedicated to enabling self-organization of communities, at bioregional scales (somewhere between local and global), dedicated to manifesting regenerative--Life-affirming--patterns in the world. 

What: LifeWeb is an online space of pure potential (an uncontested space, "above" or "outside" the internet), where the thickness of relations we can only currently intuit become visible. 

How: LifeWeb is built around a continuous pathway, that guides participants as they inhabit, that is, living into the fullness of their Being: a transformative journey from self-actualization to system-actualization. 

Process: The complete LifeWeb journey spans over 12 steps, divided into 3 segments (self, field, system) as follows:

### A. [[0.5. Co-Here-ing Wholeness|Co-Here-ing Wholeness]]: Finding your here together
In the first segment of the LifeWeb pathway (steps 1-4), Persons move from fragmented experience of reality[^1] towards falling into place within the nested wholes. 

### B. [[4.5. Activating Being|Activating Being]]: Discovering how immense we really are
In the second segment of the LifeWeb pathway (steps 5-8), Persons move from presence in their nested wholes towards radical participation within transformative ecosystems.
### C. [[8.5. Generating Aliveness|Generating Aliveness]]: Re-patterning our world
In the third segment of the of LifeWeb pathway (steps 9-12), Participants move from participating in transformative ecosystems towards generating pathways together that transpose regenerative patterns form LifeWeb into the real world.
