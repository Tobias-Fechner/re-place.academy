# Voyaging
### Intro
In short, a voyage can be thought of as a holistic, multi-week hackathon - a co-creation immersive. Yet, it is so much more. Voyaging is a self-organised action-learning journey, guided by a theme, the needs of the place in which it is hosted, and the premise of radical collaboration. Each voyage is designed as an exercise in regenerative systems actualisation: nested levels of engagement, grounded in place, working toward developing the essence and wholeness of their [[0.5. Co-Here-ing Wholeness|co-herence]].

> *"Co-creation is a non-linear process that involves multiple actors and stakeholders in the ideation, implementation and assessment of products, services, policies and systems with the aim of improving their efficiency and effectiveness, and the satisfaction of those who take part in the process."* ~ SISCODE, 2019 [^1]
### Voyage Preparation
For a given voyage, a multi-disciplinary cohort is woven together, with resonant lines of work that gesture toward latent collaborative potentials. Leading up to a voyage, voyagers are given the time and space to share, with vulnerability, the deeper meaning of their life's work. Held in a safe space, this is an opportunity to build depth of relation with other voyagers who empathise and find mutual interest with their intentions. Finding some alignment of purpose before the event begins, voyagers then enter into a co-living environment ([[Astralship]]) - a commons - where they're required to bring their whole selves to co-create the culture and social fabric that forms the foundation of the experience. Voyages are further potentialised by partner relations, whether technical ([[Hypha]], [[Holochain]]), practical ([[Wada]]) or programmatic ([[Regenesis Institute]], [[Gwyrddni]]), there to integrate further layers into the process and intervene at critical moments with an alternative perspective. Voyagers are facilitated by the host team who are themselves practicing the various components of a given voyaging methodology. Once the voyage is underway, the conditions created are the basis for emergence and transformation, although navigating complexity is not straight-forward. 
### Conditions for Emergence
In the weeks leading up to the voyage, the following infrastructures were set up: 
1. Voice-based energy accounting - for voyagers to be able to account for their time and energy invested into the collaboration
2. Appreciation bot - an example of how a simple chat-integration can be used to 
[[Hypha]]: DAO activation: 
[[Holochain]]: currency: making visible value flows: data sovereignty: 
[[Regenesis Institute]]: organisational change technology: (w)holistic/ regenerative paradigm integrity: 
[[Wada]]: p2p learning: community learning hub network: 
[[Astralship]]: voyaging (action-learning): self-organising host: incubation: cohering:
