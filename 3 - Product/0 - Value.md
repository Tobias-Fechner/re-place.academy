# Voyaging
### Intro
In short, a voyage can be thought of as a holistic, multi-week hackathon - a co-creation immersive. Yet, it is so much more. Voyaging is a self-organised action-learning journey, guided by a theme, the needs of the place in which it is hosted, and the premise of radical collaboration. Each voyage is designed as an exercise in regenerative systems actualisation: nested levels of engagement, grounded in place, working toward developing the essence and wholeness of their [[0.5. Co-Here-ing Wholeness|co-herence]].

> *"Co-creation is a non-linear process that involves multiple actors and stakeholders in the ideation, implementation and assessment of products, services, policies and systems with the aim of improving their efficiency and effectiveness, and the satisfaction of those who take part in the process."* ~ SISCODE, 2019 [^1]
### Voyage Preparation
For a given voyage, a multi-disciplinary cohort is woven together, with resonant lines of work that gesture toward latent collaborative potentials. Leading up to a voyage, voyagers are given the time and space to share, with vulnerability, the deeper meaning of their life's work. Held in a safe space, this is an opportunity to build depth of relation with other voyagers who empathise and find mutual interest with their intentions. Finding some alignment of purpose before the event begins, voyagers then enter into a co-living environment ([[Astralship]]) - a commons - where they're required to bring their whole selves to co-create the culture and social fabric that forms the foundation of the experience. Voyages are further potentialised by partner relations, whether technical ([[Hypha]], [[Holochain]]), practical ([[Wada]]) or programmatic ([[Regenesis Institute]], [[GwyrddNi]]), there to integrate further layers into the process and intervene at critical moments with an alternative perspective. Voyagers are facilitated by the host team who are themselves practicing the various components of a given voyaging methodology. Once the voyage is underway, the conditions created are the basis for emergence and transformation, although this isn't guaranteed. 
### Conditions for Emergence
In the weeks leading up to the voyage, the following instruments were set up to support radical participation in the process:
1. Voice-based energy accounting (implemented) - for voyagers to be able to account for their time and energy invested into the collaboration
2. Appreciation bot (implemented) - one example of how a simple chat-integration can be used to make visible different flows that occur in the formation of a relational field
3. Voice-based learning modules (demo) - a means to create and share how a given system can be seen, understood and cared for toward higher orders of its actualisation
4. Sociocracy (implemented) - decentralised, consent-based decision-making, actively practiced at least twice daily in morning and evening circles
5. Calendar event scheduling and integrated communications (implemented) - for dynamic conferencing, with the possibility to involve remote participants as a means for them to be able to share in the co-learning process.

Specific to the Re:place Academy voyage, with its theme of `knowledge commoning and peer-to-peer learning`, the following partnerships were formed:
1. [[Hypha]] was engaged as a means for the cohort to be able to form as a an organisational entity (a DAO) to continue the decentralised decision-making practiced throughout the co-living period, initiated with a dynamic equity share made possible by the energy accounting practice.
2. [[Holochain]] was engaged to explore bringing peer-to-peer value flows on-chain, such as expressions of thanks with the appreciation bot.
3. [[Regenesis Institute]] influenced the approach to the event design considerably, leveraging the frameworks that make up their place-sourced organisational development technology.
4. [[Wada]] engaged the voyage with the possibility to carry forward the learnings and capabilities grown to their network of tech-focussed community learning centres across 11 countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
5. [[GwyrddNi]], [[Tydden Teg]] and [[Cae Mabon]] were instrumental in grounding the design thinking explored during the voyage in real needs of local community work among the Gwynedd region, and the Peris valley in particular.

LifeWeb is a means for agents to participate in cultivating knowledge and learning through 12 orders of relating in an emerging autonomous ecosystem. What does that [[Framework Intro|mean]]?
### Personal Librarian
**Intro:** During the last phase of the voyage, a prototype was developed that demonstrated schema-based curation of a personal web of relational knowledge, presented as an interactive visualisation with the Obsidian UI. The schemas, which are defined by users, specify how knowledge should be organised, unlocking the capability to not only navigate a complex knowledge space, but importantly the capability *to define their perspectives into those spaces*. In contrast to traditional search, in which users are downstream consumers of indexed content, generated by a predefined algorithm, the librarian approach encourages upstream thinking and active participation in how their viewpoints shape the relevance of their information. This promotes a reflective and intentional approach to knowledge management and meaning-making.

**Application to the internet:** In subsequent development, this same schema-based search is being extended to a web-crawler, akin to the [Arc](https://arc.net/) search engine, giving users the means to access the internet's resources to curate their knowledge spaces.

**Richness of relations:** Although the standard interface is currently limited to one-dimensional edges between nodes, showing just a link, a top priority for future developments would be to incorporate additional dimensions of relation between nodes, in alignment with the underlying organising [[Framework Intro|framework]].

| Paradigm Difference                | Traditional Search                        | Schema-Based Search                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search mechanism**               | Predefined algorithms and categories      | User-defined schemas and perspectives                                                                            |
| **Upstream Curation of Knowledge** | Downstream consumption of indexed content | Upstream approach to curating and organizing knowledge                                                           |
| **Holistic Construction**          | Based on keyword matches and algorithms   | Searching by pattern, integrating diverse sources, maintaining contextual information, and mapping relationships |
### Tending to Relations
Although powerful in and of itself, the above outlined knowledge curation is greatly enlivened when expanding from the scope of an individual person, to the scope of a person contextualised within a community. In this way, a person [[0.5. Co-Here-ing Wholeness|inhabits]] a shared space - a knowledge commons - as part of a community collectively creating meaning-making. The individual's microcosm of meaning becomes part of a plurality of intentions within a community, governed by the tending to their interrelations.

This is the potential opened up by the [[Framework Intro|12-step]] community organising framework, and the two together highlights the yin-yang complementarity between the internet content from prevailing paradigms and the [[8.5. Generating Aliveness|re-patterning]] required by regenerative development pathways. Navigating this middle ground is precisely the interplay between what is and what could be, outlined in the three horizons framework [^2] for systems change. 

This tooling is suitable to the context of community learning hubs, which play a central role in connecting people in a local area and stewarding the energy around a given event/ movement. In such a project, many people pass through these hubs and their relations can often remain implicit. A framework guiding the development of these relations through higher orders of organising is crucial for network hub systems to actualise their potential as community catalysts. The stakeholder groups outlined in [[1 - Use Cases]] give some examples of the different manifestations of the same underlying community network hub pattern.
### Digital Identity
The accounting of a person inhabiting such a space was deduced as a strong place to start developing this infrastructure since this component will likely be consistently required going forwards. As such the development of a LifeWeb digital identity is one of the next steps on teh
