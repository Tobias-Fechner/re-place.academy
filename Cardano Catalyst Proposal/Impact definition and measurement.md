# { IMPACT } Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community

Please include here a description of how you intend to measure impact (whether quantitative or qualitative) and how and with whom you will share your outputs:

- In what way will the success of your project bring value to the Cardano Community? 
- How will you measure this impact? 
- How will you share the outputs and opportunities that result from your project?

# In what way will the success of your project bring value to the Cardano Community?
**Adoption and utility:** One of the most tangible ways this project creates positive impact on the wider Cardano community is the partnerships that can be formed, specifically with networks of regenerative practitioners and Holochain. The layered architecture proposed (p2p exchanges, federated hub network, integrations and presentation) and the nature of a multi-hub network of place-based learning communities will create a huge volume of transactions related to real-world challenges, and generate insight into novel ways for Cardano to be utilised for these aims. 

**Community Engagement:** Our engagements with local talent and communities, as well as the more global network of volunteers and impact entrepreneurs will foster engagement among the Cardano community and further collaboration within the Cardano ecosystem more broadly. By providing opportunities to learn a more embodied understanding of participatory governance, decentralised decision-making, and project development, our work will enhance the will of individuals within the Cardano community to find ways to incorporate these learnings in their innovations. 

**Ecosystem Growth:** Our partnerships with other hubs, impact funders, and technical partners can contribute to the growth and expansion of the Cardano ecosystem. We hope this way to attract new users, developers, investors, and partners to help Cardano continue to grow as a leading blockchain platform for innovation grounded in real-world use cases.
# How will you measure impact? 
1. **Adoption and Utility**
	- **Partnerships Formed:** Our project is all about leveraging partnerships. We'll make the number and quality of partnerships formed visible, assessing their potential impact on Cardano's utility and adoption. 
    - **Transaction Volume and Impact Verification:** Our work is inseparable from learning community resilience. Therefore, the volume and frequency of transactions will be a good indicator of how Cardano is translating into addressing real-world challenges.
    - **Feedback and Testimonials:** We'll be gathering feedback and testimonials from partners, users, and stakeholders on how each event has contributed to enhancing utility and adoption of Cardano within their respective communities and industries. Some events may even be filmed to give an impression of the qualitative shift from our engagements. 
    
2. **Community Engagement:**
    
    - **Participant Engagement:** We'll monitor levels of engagement among local talent, communities, volunteers, and participants involved in project activities, including attendance at events, participation in online discussions, and energy contributions. We'll present these per project as well as make aggregations for the whole network. 
    - **P2P Learning Exchanges:** Any event participant or resident will be able to encode and share their certificate of learning about participatory governance and decentralised decision-making, bringing a new way for the Cardano ecosystem to be able to find and collaborate with relevant peers. 
    
3. **Ecosystem Growth:**
    
    - **Network Growth:** We'll be tracking indicators of ecosystem growth, such as the increase in the number of users, projects, transactions, and future catalyst fund rounds within the Cardano ecosystem, resulting from our efforts to attract and onboard new participants.
    - **Community Outreach:** As always, easure the reach and impact of community outreach efforts, including marketing campaigns, events, and educational initiatives, in attracting and engaging new stakeholders and contributors to the Cardano ecosystem.
