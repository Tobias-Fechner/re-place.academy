The Daily Drops are an effort to create a space of brief storytelling through the play of sounds and voices. The rule of it is that it's 1 minute each. 

Eventually this exercise will become easier (social technology) until the storytelling is refined and polished in a way that it's easily understandable to alien parties. 

Storytelling is like a dance. Sometimes it doesn't have a purpose. As humans we just like to tell stories and we use it as a mirror to understand more about ourselves. It's a movement that is never ending. It's always changing.
