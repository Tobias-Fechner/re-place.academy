Bennett: 
Polarity arises not solely by the juxtaposition of two wholes but by the formation of a dipole. (...) Polarity thus emerges as an inevitable consequence of the recognition of wholeness as an element of experience that is not its totality. The antithesis of 'this and not that' leaves us with two bare, or unrelated, terms. We discover, however, that the elements of our experience are always related; hence we find emerging the third category of relatedness, which requires at least three terms for its exemplification.

More from Bennett:
The assertion that two objects are connected implies that they are also in some way separate. Words such as 'opposite', 'contradictory', 'divided', 'contrary', 'exclusive', all imply a disconnection that would be meaningless if there were no connection. We may use the term dyad in a special sense to designate any pair of terms between which both connection and disjunction can be recognized. 'Man and woman' is a dyad, and other examples that can be readily recognized are 'heat and cold', 'present and absent', 'inner and outer', 'like and dislike', 'greater and less', 'true and false'. Such pairs as 'wood and paper', 'tea and coffee', 'yesterday and tomorrow', 'perhaps and rather' are also dyads, since in each pair of terms we can recognize a common property that gives meaning to the opposition. However, the two terms of a dyad need not have any essential property in common. Indeed, the connection may be no more than the fact that they happen to be brought together by some accidental association of ideas. For example, 'cooking and yesterday morning', 'greater than and copper', can both be taken in such a way as to exhibit two ideas set in opposition and yet associated in a specific connection.

With these explanations, we can assert that any and every pair of wholes, existing or non-existing, can be regarded as a dyad in the sense above indicated. Although all pairs are dyads, the greater majority are trivial in that the two terms stand to one another only in a weak opposition and with an insignificant connection. Even where the polar opposition is clearest, there remains in every dyad some unopposed element common to both members of the pair. For example, heat and cold are not entirely exclusive terms, because there is some heat even in the coldest object. Truth or falsehood can never be asserted absolutely of any dyadic proposition.

The principle of polarity can be formulated shortly.

Polarity always gives rise to force. We must be careful not to make the mistake of supposing that a force is the same thing as a relationship. Positive and negative electric charges cannot exist together, and therefore cannot be said to be related to one another, although in juxtaposition they do produce a force. Through polarity, everything that exists is in a state of strain which polarity itself can do nothing to relieve. Hence polarity can never be a final principle of explanation.* As modes of expression, wholeness is too comfortable to be satisfying and polarity is too uncomfortable to be endured. The dyad is always a source of disturbance, compelling us to penetrate more deeply into the matter in hand.

Without force nothing can move, but force alone does not make movement possible. The world viewed as a system of dyads would consist of connected but unrelated wholes, of opposites seeking reconciliation but unable to find it. The number two cannot get beyond itself. The dyad is closed, but its closure is not that of completeness.

Through polarity, we find everywhere in our experience oppositions of order and chaos, of good and evil, of truth and falsehood, of self and other; but polarity can show us neither how these oppositions arise nor how they can be resolved.
