Bennett: 
Relationship is not merely the reconciliation of opposites, but the totality of a system in which three independent factors are joined to make one. (...) Relatedness, in turn, is incomplete unless we bring it back to immediate experience with the characteristics of 'thus and so'.

More from Bennett: 
All real relationships are reducible to the combination of three independent elements standing to one another as affirming, denying, and reconciling influences.

A relationship is not itself a whole, nor is it a property of the wholes which it relates. Hence no principle of relatedness can be reached merely by combining wholeness and polarity. Since logic is based on these two latter principles, relatedness goes beyond logic. Hence it is that the attempt to study relatedness by way of the dyad 'terms and relations' proves unsuccessful. 'transcend the pairs of opposites'.

If relationship cannot arise from two terms alone, nor from anything derived from either of them, it must require at least three terms; and we discover it to be that very property which enters experience through the triad. The most important, and in some ways the most difficult, idea to be grasped is that a relational triad is constituted only to the extent that the three terms present are independent. If any one of the three terms can be inferred from the other two, then we are dealing not with a relationship but with wholeness or polarity. For example, heat—cold—iron do not constitute a relationship, for heat and cold are not independent factors. If, however, we take fire—heat—iron, we suggest a relationship whereby fire and iron are related through heat, heat and iron through fire, and heat and fire through iron. In the former case we have only the conception of the force of heat and cold confronted in a piece of iron, but not of a relationship. The requirement of independence introduces an element of order that we do not find in the principles of wholeness and polarity. A relationship is not characterized by the mere fact that three terms are present, since it is also necessary to take account of the manner in which they come together. For example, the triad child—mother—father, which stands for the evocative power of the child over the relations of man and woman, is quite different from the triad father—mother—child, which represents the generative action of the male principle confronted with the female.

It must further be noted that each of the three terms of a triad makes its own specific contribution to the character of the relationship. One of the terms will always have the character of affirmation, or activity; the second will have that of denial; while the third will appear neither as active nor passive, but as the reconciliation of the other two. We may find it difficult to recognize these characters in every situation, because of the many different forms in which they can be manifested. Affirmation is always positive and active, but it can have many different shades; denial can range from violent opposition to inertness and passivity; and within this range there can be such other characteristics as receptivity, response, and co-operation. The third character may be no more than the result of the meeting of active and passive forces, or it may appear as an act of freedom bringing into existence a situation that without it would not have arisen at all. The two triads already discussed differ in the significance of the child as third term. In the first triad the child is pure potentiality—that is, freedom, whereas in the second, it is the temporal actualization—that is, the result.

Because of all the different gradations of meaning that can be taken by the three primal characters, relationships can have an endless variety, but all can be reduced to triads. An apparent relationship of the kind A bought B from C for D shillings* is really two triads—one a 'buying' triad and one a 'price' triad. Moreover, it is not a true tetrad; for the terms B and D are not independent, since the price D is meaningless without reference to the object B. Similarly, Russell's pentadic relationship—'A minds B's love for C more than D's hatred of E'—is composed of four triads with the relationships 'love', 'hatred', 'minding', and 'more than'.
