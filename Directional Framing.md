Communities are seeking ways to evolve how they inhabit their place. With increasing complexity (climate change, destabilisation of the biosphere, social unrest etc) comes the increasing need to be able to sense-make and respond creatively. This is a process of developing new patterns, structures and processes in right relationship with the systems that give communities their life. 

This work shows up as networks of solidarity, community-led climate-action programmes, as novel approaches to governance, and practices to remember into a larger body.
