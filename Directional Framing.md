Communities are seeking ways to evolve how they inhabit their place. With increasing complexity comes the increasing need to be able to sense-make and respond creatively. This is a process of developing new patterns, structures and processes in right relationship with the systems that give communities their life. 

This work shows up as networks of solidarity, community-led climate-action programmes, and as novel approaches to governance, as harvest celebrations, as practices to remember into a larger body, and many, many more. Many initiatives make promising beginnings and yet remain invisible at large. What's needed is to be able to see the potential of the movement as a whole. In doing so, inhabiting uncontested spaces of co-creation, ever more richly diverse and increasingly differentiated. 

We propose a participatory system that supports the ability for communities to organise themselves for bioregional transformation, starting with the individual.
