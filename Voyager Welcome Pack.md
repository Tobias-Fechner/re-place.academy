**2. Voyage Preparation** (updated)

- **Onboarding Process:**
    
    - The onboarding process for this Voyage is intentionally designed to foster a sense of shared purpose and collective responsibility. It begins with a welcome call with crew members, who will guide you through the journey ahead.
- **Crewing & the Roster of Agreement:**
    
    - **What is Crewing?** It's the process of forming our collaborative team (the crew) and solidifying our shared intention to embark on this voyage together. We'll utilize tools like micro-solidarity, affinity mapping, and the Regenerative Nexus cohort discovery guide to find our collective rhythm and identify how our individual strengths can contribute to the whole.
    - **The Roster of Agreement:** This is the culmination of our pre-voyage connection and co-creation. It's a symbolic document that outlines:
        - A shared image or vision for the voyage, reflecting the potential we aim to realize.
        - An initial configuration of roles, ensuring each crew member feels seen and valued in their unique contribution.
        - Our voyage needs, both material and intangible, that we'll work together to address.
    - **Your Role:** As a Voyager, your active participation in crafting this roster is crucial. You'll be asked to share your individual aspirations, the unique essence you bring to the table, and the ways in which you envision your work aligning with the larger purpose.
    - **Co-Creating Clarity:** Through a series of online calls and collaborative tools (like Obsidian), we'll weave together our individual threads into a tapestry of shared intention and mutual support.
